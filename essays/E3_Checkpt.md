### 1. Show what each page will look like. The pages do not have to be “functional” but the design should clear.

Click [here]() to watch a screencast where I present the design and functionality of my e-commerce website. 

### 2. Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.

I plan to have my shopping cart be on a separate page that the user can view and edit to their liking (adding or removing quantities). I thought that it would be nice to have a side bar shopping cart, so that users can just edit their quantities and shopping cart without being directed to another page, but I'm not confident about accomplishing this. If I feel that I have the time, I might challenge myself with making the shopping cart a side bar feature. I have a purchase button on the products display page at the moment, but I will probably change this to checkout. If the user selects valid quantities and is logged in, they will be sent to the shopping cart page. On the shopping cart page, there would be a "complete purchase" button and a "continue shopping" button. The "complete purchase" button would redirect the user to the invoice page where they can see what they purchased. 

### 3. Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.



### 4. How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?



### 5. Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)



### 6. If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?

I am not working with a partner. 

### 7. How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?

With the Assignment 3 Extra Credit opportunity, I will be forced to list all of the tasks for this assignment in advance, which will help me stay organized and visualize what exactly I need to do. I did this midway of doing Assignment 2, which helped with my progress, so I hope that my journey to finishing Assignment 3 will be smoother than it was for Assignment 2.
