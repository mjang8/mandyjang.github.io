### 1. Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)

My e-commerce website sells a variety of Japanese drinks, including soda or carbonated drinks, juices, and tea drinks. 

### 2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?



### 3. Describe what you are most proud of about your system:



### 4. Describe what you are least happy with your system:



### 5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?



### 6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?

When I ran into a problem, I tended to trace back my steps to see if I could identify the issue. If I couldn't fix the problem right away on my own, I would rely on the Assignment 3 examples, the internet, and ChatGPT to help me. 

### 7. Describe what worked well in doing this assignment. 



### 8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment. 



### 9. What did you learn from doing this assignment?



### 10. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?

If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would have definitely started sooner. The week that Assignment 3 was assigned just so happened to be the busiest week of the semester for me, where I had a final exam and two presentations to prepare for. Even if I did not have the time to actually start the assignment itself, I really wish I spent more time trying to understand the cookies and sessions lab, as this would have made my progress a lot smoother. 

### 11. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

For Assignment 3, I would say I spent 30% of the time thinking, 15% writing code, and 55% of the time testing and debugging. 

### 12. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)

I did not work in a team.
